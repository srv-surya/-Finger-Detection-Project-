# -Finger-Detection-Project-
This project uses Mediapipe + OpenCV to detect hand landmarks and count how many fingers are raised in real time. It tracks thumb distance and finger tip positions relative to joints, then displays the count on a live webcam feed. Simple, fast, and works with any standard camera.
